Great direction ðŸš€ â€” what you want is essentially a master prompt / work plan that an AI code-generation assistant (like Copilot, Cursor, Aider, or OpenAIâ€™s own AI coding tools) can follow to scaffold, implement, and maintain the WhoAndWhat project according to the specs weâ€™ve designed.
Hereâ€™s a structured work plan you can feed into your AI tool:

ðŸ“Œ AI Work Plan â€“ WhoAndWhat App Development
1. Project Overview
Develop a task & contact management application called WhoAndWhat, consisting of:
        â€¢ Backend: ASP.NET Core Web API (.NET 8), PostgreSQL, Clean Architecture, JWT Auth, Serilog logging, Swagger/OpenAPI docs.
        â€¢ Web Client: React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS, API integration, PWA-ready.
        â€¢ Mobile Client: React Native (Expo), push notifications, shared logic with web when possible.
        â€¢ Deployment: Docker for local dev, GitHub Actions for CI/CD, production deploy to Azure or AWS.
Core Features:
        â€¢ User accounts (registration, login, subscription tier: free vs premium)
        â€¢ Contacts (invite via QR/code, association, blocking)
        â€¢ Tasks with categories (task, idea, event, appointment, medical, bill, project with subtasks, shopping, requests)
        â€¢ Calendar (personal + shared)
        â€¢ Messaging (internal + optional email CC, auto-expiration)
        â€¢ Notifications (reminders + push)

2. Backend (.NET 8 API with PostgreSQL)
        1. Setup & Architecture
                â—‹ Create solution WhoAndWhat.sln with projects:
                        Â§ WhoAndWhat.Api (controllers, DI setup, Swagger)
                        Â§ WhoAndWhat.Application (CQRS, business logic, DTOs, MediatR)
                        Â§ WhoAndWhat.Domain (entities, enums, aggregates)
                        Â§ WhoAndWhat.Infrastructure (EF Core, PostgreSQL, Serilog, email provider, Redis optional)
                â—‹ Add Swagger (Swashbuckle), Serilog, FluentValidation.
        2. Authentication
                â—‹ JWT (access token 1h, refresh token 30d)
                â—‹ Register, login, refresh, password reset endpoints
        3. Entities (EF Core + PostgreSQL)
                â—‹ Users, Contacts, Tasks, Subtasks, ShoppingLists, ShoppingItems, Messages, Notifications
                â—‹ Apply migrations with EF Core
        4. API Endpoints
                â—‹ Implement per API draft v0.1 (Auth, Users, Contacts, Tasks, Projects, Shopping, Requests, Calendar, Messaging, Notifications)
                â—‹ Enforce free vs premium tier limits via middleware
        5. Testing
                â—‹ Unit tests (xUnit + Moq)
                â—‹ Integration tests (WebApplicationFactory)
                â—‹ Swagger/Postman collections

3. Deployment & DevOps
        1. Local Dev
                â—‹ Docker Compose: api, postgres, pgadmin, redis (optional)
                â—‹ Run web + mobile clients separately
        2. CI/CD
                â—‹ GitHub Actions: build, run tests, build Docker images
                â—‹ Push to container registry (Azure ACR / AWS ECR)
        3. Production
                â—‹ Deploy API + Postgres in Azure (App Service + Azure Database for PostgreSQL) or AWS ECS/RDS
                â—‹ Configure monitoring (Application Insights or CloudWatch)
                â—‹ Use Key Vault/Secrets Manager for JWT keys + DB creds

4. Premium vs Free Enforcement
        â€¢ Free tier: max 20 contacts + 100 tasks
        â€¢ Premium: unlimited + projects with subtasks + advanced reminders + shared calendar + email CC in messages

5. AI Coding Instructions
When generating code, follow these rules:
        â€¢ Use Clean Architecture layering (API â†’ Application â†’ Domain â†’ Infrastructure).
        â€¢ Use DTOs from the API draft for request/response contracts.
        â€¢ Write EF Core entities that map cleanly to PostgreSQL.
        â€¢ Always generate migrations when entities change.
        â€¢ Write unit tests for services, integration tests for endpoints.
        â€¢ Ensure Swagger/OpenAPI is kept updated.
        â€¢ Use dependency injection for all services.
        â€¢ Use async/await for all DB + API operations.
